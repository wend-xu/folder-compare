# Folder Compare Architecture (Phase 1-10)

## Crate responsibilities

- `fc-core`: owns directory compare and text diff domain model, public API, and error contracts.
- `fc-ai`: owns AI-based interpretation for diff outputs through a provider abstraction.
- `fc-ui-slint`: owns desktop app entry, app state orchestration, and UI presentation.

## `fc-core` internal boundaries (Phase 7)

- `api/`: external entry points (`compare_dirs`, `diff_text_file`).
- `domain/`: pure domain types (requests/options/report/entry/diff/error).
- `services/`:
  - `scanner`: recursive traversal and indexed scan output per root;
  - `comparer`: left/right path alignment, node classification, and report entry assembly;
  - `large_dir`: soft/hard limit evaluation and policy planning for large-directory protection;
  - `hasher`: deterministic file-level content comparison (`size + bytes`) as fallback;
  - `text_loader`: text candidate detection + BOM/encoding-aware decode boundary;
  - `text_diff`: summary-level diff for `compare_dirs` plus detailed diff building for `diff_text_file`.
- `infra/`: path normalization and relative-path key generation plus thin fs helpers.

The dependency direction is kept as: `api -> services -> domain/infra`, and `domain` does not depend on `services`.

## Why `fc-core` must stay pure

`fc-core` is the foundation for correctness and determinism. It must stay independent from UI/runtime frameworks and remote AI services so that:

- core compare behavior remains testable and reusable;
- future CLI, UI, and service adapters can share the same engine;
- behavior does not depend on network state or provider variability.

## Why AI analysis is outside the core engine

AI analysis is optional, probabilistic, and provider-dependent. Core compare output must be available even when AI is disabled or unavailable. Keeping AI in `fc-ai` preserves a strict boundary between deterministic compare results and optional interpretation.

## Why UI only handles orchestration and presentation

UI should not embed compare business logic. `fc-ui-slint` translates user intent into calls to `fc-core`/`fc-ai`, then renders results. This keeps domain logic centralized and easier to test.

## `fc-core` API maturity after Phase 7

- `compare_dirs` now performs:
  - request validation and root normalization;
  - recursive scan and path alignment;
  - directory-level soft/hard limit evaluation for aligned entries and total bytes;
  - policy-based large-directory handling:
    - `Normal`: continue with warnings in large mode;
    - `SummaryFirst`: return summary-first output and allow truncation under hard limits;
    - `RefuseAboveHardLimit`: fail fast with structured error under hard limits;
  - text detail deferral in large mode and for oversized text files;
  - deterministic file-level comparison fallback when text path is deferred or unavailable.
- `diff_text_file` now performs:
  - full input validation and path normalization;
  - text loading via shared Phase 5 detection/decoding boundary;
  - per-file detailed diff input size guard (`max_file_size_bytes`) with structured boundary error;
  - structured detailed diff output with hunks, lines, line kinds, and line numbers;
  - local output limiting via `truncated + warning`.
- The report can now express:
  - left-only / right-only paths;
  - type mismatch between aligned paths;
  - aligned directories;
  - aligned files as `Equal` or `Different` from text summary, deferred text detail, or byte-level fallback;
  - large-mode and summary-first-mode flags in summary;
  - deferred-detail counters and oversized-text counters;
  - report-level truncation and warning messages for policy-triggered limits.
- `compare_dirs` remains summary-oriented and does not emit detailed hunk output.

## `fc-ai` API maturity after Phase 8

- DTO contract now includes:
  - request context (`task`, `relative_path`, `language_hint`, `diff_excerpt`, `summary`, `truncation_note`, `config`);
  - response fields for UI cards (`risk_level`, `title`, `rationale`, `key_points`, `review_suggestions`);
  - provider-neutral `PromptPayload`.
- Structured `AiError` now distinguishes:
  - invalid request;
  - prompt build failure;
  - input preparation failure;
  - provider execution failure;
  - response parse failure;
  - not implemented.
- Analyzer orchestration now performs:
  - request validation;
  - diff input preparation/truncation with note propagation;
  - provider-neutral prompt payload assembly;
  - provider invocation;
  - response normalization and parse-boundary checks.
- Mock provider now:
  - deterministic;
  - supports `Summary`, `RiskReview`, and `ReviewComments`;
  - produces stable `risk_level`, `title`, `rationale`, `key_points`, and `review_suggestions`.
- OpenAI-compatible provider remains placeholder with explicit `NotImplemented` boundary and stable provider name.

## `fc-ui-slint` MVP maturity after Phase 10

- Main window now supports:
  - left/right directory path input;
  - compare trigger button;
  - compare status, summary, warning, and error display;
  - flat result list (`relative_path/status/detail`) with row selection state;
  - detailed diff panel driven by `fc-core::diff_text_file`, including:
    - selected path display;
    - hunk/line list display (`old_line_no/new_line_no/kind/content`);
    - diff warning and diff truncated semantics;
    - diff-level error display isolated from compare-level errors.
- UI orchestration boundaries:
  - `commands`: user actions and compare execution trigger;
  - `presenter`: compare workflow plus selected-row detailed diff orchestration;
  - `bridge`: request construction and `CompareReport`/`TextDiffResult` to UI view-model mapping;
  - `state/view_models`: lightweight, UI-facing data only.
- `fc-core` integration now includes:
  - `compare_dirs` for summary list;
  - `diff_text_file` for selected-row detailed diff.

## Still deferred after Phase 10

- real remote provider execution (HTTP/API integration) is not implemented.
- UI and AI analysis integration flow is not implemented.

## Next implementation priority

Phase 11 should focus on UI integration with `fc-ai` mock provider:

1. selected diff panel output to `AnalyzeDiffRequest` mapping;
2. `fc-ai` analyzer invocation with deterministic mock provider in UI flow;
3. AI card rendering with explicit fallback when AI is disabled or unavailable.
