# Folder Compare Architecture (Phase 1-5)

## Crate responsibilities

- `fc-core`: owns directory compare and text diff domain model, public API, and error contracts.
- `fc-ai`: owns AI-based interpretation for diff outputs through a provider abstraction.
- `fc-ui-slint`: owns desktop app entry, app state orchestration, and UI presentation.

## `fc-core` internal boundaries (Phase 5)

- `api/`: external entry points (`compare_dirs`, `diff_text_file`).
- `domain/`: pure domain types (requests/options/report/entry/diff/error).
- `services/`:
  - `scanner`: recursive traversal and indexed scan output per root;
  - `comparer`: left/right path alignment, node classification, and report entry assembly;
  - `hasher`: deterministic file-level content comparison (`size + bytes`) as fallback;
  - `text_loader`: text candidate detection + BOM/encoding-aware decode boundary;
  - `text_diff`: summary-level text diff for `compare_dirs` enrichment.
- `infra/`: path normalization and relative-path key generation plus thin fs helpers.

The dependency direction is kept as: `api -> services -> domain/infra`, and `domain` does not depend on `services`.

## Why `fc-core` must stay pure

`fc-core` is the foundation for correctness and determinism. It must stay independent from UI/runtime frameworks and remote AI services so that:

- core compare behavior remains testable and reusable;
- future CLI, UI, and service adapters can share the same engine;
- behavior does not depend on network state or provider variability.

## Why AI analysis is outside the core engine

AI analysis is optional, probabilistic, and provider-dependent. Core compare output must be available even when AI is disabled or unavailable. Keeping AI in `fc-ai` preserves a strict boundary between deterministic compare results and optional interpretation.

## Why UI only handles orchestration and presentation

UI should not embed compare business logic. `fc-ui-slint` translates user intent into calls to `fc-core`/`fc-ai`, then renders results. This keeps domain logic centralized and easier to test.

## `fc-core` API maturity after Phase 5

- `compare_dirs` now performs:
  - request validation and root normalization;
  - recursive scan and path alignment;
  - text candidate detection and safe decode attempt for aligned files;
  - summary-level text diff when text path succeeds;
  - deterministic byte-level comparison fallback when text path is not applicable or decode fails.
- The report can now express:
  - left-only / right-only paths;
  - type mismatch between aligned paths;
  - aligned directories;
  - aligned files as `Equal` or `Different` from either text summary or byte-level fallback.
- `diff_text_file` remains a validated skeleton with deferred algorithm stage.

## Still deferred after Phase 5

- detailed text diff / hunk API for external callers;
- large directory protection details.

## Next implementation priority

Phase 6 should focus on detailed `diff_text_file` API completion:

1. reuse current text loading/normalization boundaries;
2. provide explicit detailed diff output contract around hunks/lines;
3. keep compare pipeline stable while deepening text diff capabilities.
